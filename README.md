## Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan
* What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
   * Jennifer’s overall strength is backend development. Aaron’s overall strength is in project management, and programming in general. Jon’s overall strength
* How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
   * Jennifer: I can help with overall design of the project and the wireframe portion for the project and backend portion. Aaron strength is coordinating project and helping lead the project. In addition, and help write and review the functionality for the app. Jon:
* In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
   * Jennifer: I would like to get better at knowing the flow of react. And get better at pair programming as well. Aaron would like to improve his teamwork and collaboration skills. Jon:
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
   * We propose that we divide the daily task to each person of the group. IN which, we work independently. But, we would stay on Remo so we can rely on each other if needed. We would also do review code before merging. Thus, we would explain our code before merging our code into Github.


## Conflict Plan
* What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises? 
   * We propose any conflicts that arise will be involved between those who are involved. If the conflict escalates, then the whole group will talk-it-out.
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
   * We propose that we would just vocalize our concerns if one person is taking over the project. When we assign our individual tasks, the person in charge of the project will have the majority of say of their portion of the project. Unless help is requested by that person involved in task. This will allow each person to have some autonomy over their own project.
* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
   * We're all adults. Thus,have some empathy for your teammates who may not be at the same level. We all agree that our main goal is to complete the project, thus working as a unit will be our main goal.
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
   * We would propose each day we’ll review each other and our project. And have open communication with each other. If one person is behind we can help them reach the goals for each day. Plus, we’ll try to find out if there is a reason for the lack of contributions.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
   * We propose that after attempts to try to resolve the issues ourselves, we would request help from our instructor Audrey.

## Communication Plan
* What hours will you be available to communicate?
   * We all agree to work from 9am to 6pm PST.
* What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
   * Platforms to communicate is Slack and Remo.
* How often will you take breaks?
   * As many as we need. No set break time.
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
   * We all agree to rely on each other if one person starts to fall behind.
* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
   * There is no expectation for anyone to respond after class hours. But, it also depends on the person and urgency.
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
   * Conscious turn-taking when we communicate. Be mindful of others when they’re talking.
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
   * We agree that our goal is finishing the project and to work cohesively. We are not expecting perfection, so no negative communication is not-allowed. We will police each other and make sure that any feedback given is positive.


## Work Plan
* How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
   * We will post on our group slack channel of any assignments/tasks that need to be done and talk as a group in remo. We will also use Github-projects or trello to help us keep track of any assignments we need to complete.
* What project management tool will be used?
   * We will be using Github projects for our project management tool.
Git Process
* What components of your project will live on GitHub?
   * The components of our project that will live on Github organization. All files, code, and our Git-hub project management tool. Maybe use Trello
* How will you share the repository with your teammates?
   *  The repository will be shared through our organization.
* What is your Git flow?
   * We agree that each individual who’s responsible for a certain portion will be able to commit to their own branch. But for staging, we’re not going to have a set time, if someone needs to stage something to complete their task, just let the others in our team know. But if it is a major application for the website, we all agree to review the code before merging to main. We will merge max once a day (end of day).
* Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
   * How many people must review a PR?
      * The full team for major pull requests and 1 for a minor update or for staging.
   * Who merges PRs?
      * Anyone except for the creator of the pull request.
   * How often will you merge?
      * We agree to merge once a day for main, but no set schedule for staging, but we all need to be aware before staging.
   * How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
      * We will agree that we will merge at the end
